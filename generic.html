									  •	In the data analysis part of the project, I have implemented Tidyr model and GGplot in R to explore the dataset and analyze a few key findings to address the problems.  <br />
									  •	In the Machine Learning part of the project, I have built a Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and LDA model to find the most significant factors by using ROC AUC to measure the accuracy of the model. The most accurate model has a higher ROC AUC to find the factors that have the most serious impact on credit card closure. As the result, the Decision Tree model has the highest ROC AUC and is the best model.</p>
